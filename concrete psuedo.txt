Get better/more aggregates
	Remove aggregates from the edge
	Process into binary image
	Stack into a 3D array in MATLAB
	Use bwconncomp() to find components that are not face-to-face (6-connected)

Build and remesh a 3D model
Select and export good aggregates to .stl files using meshlab

Path 1 | Packing problem | More computational power:
	Find algorithm that packs irregular objects
	Watershed the aggregates at overlap
Path 2 | Little overlap | Lower density:
	Make a predifined 3D matrix with mini 3D matrices (randomly sized) in between 
	Store aggregates in each mini matrix with random orientation and maximize size of aggregate (packing problem)
		Stop once all boxes are full and ideal density is reached
		or
		Remove imaginary boxes and perform transformations
Path 3 | iterative:
	Enlarge every selected aggregate a little bit.
	Put one into the defined space (a box) with random coordinates and random direction.
	Insert another aggregate
		If there is overlap:
			Redo the insertion with different coordinates or orientation
			or
			Watershed transformation
	Check the volume fraction. If the volume of all existed aggregates higher than a certain ratio of defined space, stop.
	Shrink the size of aggregates to original.
		In the end, it might still have some aggregates contact with their neighbors. Then, try to move or rotate it to separate it from their neighbors. Or even change the shape of the attached aggregates.
		or
		Watershed transformation
	If all of them are detached to each other, volume the volume fraction again. (?)
